2. **Gravity**: Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts two bodies with mass towards each other.

The idea that individuals on government assistance or benefits should not have children is both unfair and potentially harmful.

Government assistance programs are designed to provide support to those in need, including low-income families, to help them meet basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare.

2. **Physical limitations**:","The idea of elderly people not being able to travel to other dimensions is more of a concept found in science fiction and fantasy rather than something based on real scientific principles.
